C Console Calculator

It's a simple calculator for a shell written for self-learning purposes.


How to use. The basics.

Please note that each value you want to feed the program, except the "%" symbol, must be put on a separate line (in other words, hit Enter every time you put the value to console). If you'd like to close the program, you could just type "=" or "quit". It would show the subtotal value and then would be closed.


How to use. In more details.

The values are needed to be placed on the separate lines. These values can be: 
- any numbers including percentage like "10%";
- binary operators (addition "+", subtraction "-", multiplication "*", division "/", exponentiation "^");
- square root "r" (there's it's kinda a postfix operator here which returns the square root of the subtotal value).

This calculator is able to save the subtotal, so if you've misspelled while entering a value, feel free to overwrite it. This feature also provides safety for calculations considering mathematically incorrect results. 

The program also ignores input which's meaningless in the given context but this is not very exciting to see the examples of such a behavior. However, it's worth to note that when you perform exponentiation, the program checks if the exponent's correct, and it can fix the incorrect exponent.
