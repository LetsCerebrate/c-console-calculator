Please note that each value you want to feed the program must be put on a separate line (in other words, hit Enter every time you put the value to console).

The allowable operators are follows:
'+' is addition operator: [5 + 2] = 7
'-' is subtraction operator: [5 - 2] = 3
'*' is multiplication operator: [5 * 2] = 10
'/' is division operator: [5 / 2] = 2.5
'^' is exponentiation operator: [5 ^ 2] = 25
'%' is percentage operator: [1 + 50%] = 1.5
'r' is square root operator: [25 r] = 5
'=' is operator which returns result

If you'd like to close the program, you could just type "=". It would show the result of calculations or, at least, the subtotal value, and then would be closed. 

The program has some input restrictions according to the inner system of types of values. Say, you can't input several numbers or operators in a row. This won't be the cause of the crash or something, the program will just receive only the 1st value of the given type and will ignore the rest. However, this rule doesn't spread on a unary square root.

The program ignores meaningless input. Also, when you do exponentiation, the program checks if the exponent's correct, and then it can "fix" the incorrect exponent. Finally, in the case of an invalid operation, the program prints what it's been able to calculate, and then it closes itself.
